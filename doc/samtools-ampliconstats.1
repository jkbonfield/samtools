.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
samtools ampliconstats collects statistics from one or more input
alignment files and produces tables in text format.  The output can be
visualized graphically using plot-ampliconstats.

The alignment files should have previously been clipped of primer
sequence, for example by "samtools ampliconclip" and the sites of
these primers should be specified as a bed file in the arguments.
Each amplicon must be present in the bed file with one or more LEFT
primers (direction "+") followed by one or more RIGHT primers.  For
example:

.EX 2
MN908947.3  1875  1897  nCoV-2019_7_LEFT        60  +
MN908947.3  1868  1890  nCoV-2019_7_LEFT_alt0   60  +

Ampliconstats will identify which read belongs to which amplicon.  For
purposes of computing coverage statistics for amplicons with multiple
primer choices, only the innermost primer locations are used.

A summary of output sections is listed below, followed by more
detailed descriptions.

.TS
lb l .
SS	Amplicon and file counts.  Always comes first
FSS	File specific: summary stats
FRPERC	File specific: read percentage distributoin between amplicons
FDEPTH	File specific: average read depth per amplicon
FREADS	File specific: numbers of reads per amplicon
FPCOV	File specific: percent coverage per amplicon
FTLEN	File specific: template length distribution per amplicon
FAMP	File specific: amplicon correct / double / treble length counts
CSS	Combined  summary stats
CRPERC	Combined: read percentage distributoin between amplicons
CDEPTH	Combined: average read depth per amplicon
CREADS	Combined: numbers of reads per amplicon
CPCOV	Combined: percent coverage per amplicon
CTLEN	Combined: template length distribution per amplicon
CAMP	Combined: amplicon correct / double / treble length counts
.TE

File specific sections start with both the section key and the
filename basename (minus directory and .sam, .bam or .cram suffix).

Note that the file specific sections are interleaved, ordered first by
file and secondly by the file specific stats.  To collate them
together, use "grep" to pull out all data of a specific type.

The combined sections (C*) follow the same format as the file specific
sections, with a different key.  For simplicity of parsing they also
have a filename column which is filled out with "COMBINED".  These
rows contain stats aggregated across all input files.

.SH CSS SECTION

This section consists of summary counts for the entire set of input
files.   These may be useful for automatic scaling of plots.

.TS
lb l .
Number of amplicons	Total number of amplicons listed in primer.bed
Number of files	Total number of SAM, BAM or CRAM files
End of summary	Always the last item.  Marker for end of CSS block.
.TE


.SH FSS SECTION

This lists summary statistics specific to an individual input file.
The values reported are:

.TS
lb l .
raw total sequences	Total number of sequences found in the file
filtered sequences	Number of sequences filtered with -F option
failed primer match	Number of sequences that did not correspond to
	a known primer location
matching sequences	Number of sequences allocated to an amplicon
.TE

.SH FREADS / CREADS SECTION

For each amplicon, this simply reports the count of reads that have
been assigned to it.  A read is assigned to an amplicon if the start
and/or end of the read is within a specified number of bases of the
primer sites listed in the bed file.  This distance is controlled via
the -m option.

.SH FRPERC / CRPERC SECTION

For each amplicon, this lists what percentage of reads were assigned
to this amplicon out of the total number of assigned reads.  This may
be used to diagnose how uniform this distribution is.

Note this is a pure read count and has no relation to amplicon size.

.SH FDEPTH / CDEPTH SECTION

Using the reads assigned to each amplicon and their start / end
locations on that reference, computed using the POS and CIGAR fields,
we compute the total number of bases aligned to this amplicon and
corresponding the average depth.

To compute the depth the length of the amplicon is computed using the
innermost set of primers, if multiple choices are listed in the bed
file.

.SH FPCOV / CPCOV SECTION

Similar to the FDEPTH section, this is a binary status of covered or
not covered per position in each amplicon.  This is then expressed as
a percentage by dividing by the amplicon length, which is computed
using the innermost set of primers covering this amplicon.

The minimum depth necessary to constitute a position as being
"covered" is specifiable using the -d option.


.SH FTLEN / CTLEN / FAMP / CAMP SECTION

It is possible for an amplicon to be produced using incorrect primers,
giving rise to extra-long amplicons (typically double or treble
length).

The FTLEN field holds a distribution of observed TLEN fields from the
input data, up to a maximum value.  Each row consists of the file
name, the amplicon number in question, and tab separated counts of
that length.  Amplicon number zero is used as a summation across all
amplicons for this sample.

If the desired amplicons are of variable length then we can instead
count the number of reads that map to the expected ends of this
amplicon, map to this amplicon plus the neighbouring amplicon, or map
to this amplicon and another further away amplicon (usually meaning
at least treble size).  As FTLEN the format of this data is one
amplicon per row followed by the counts of correct, skip-1 and skip-2+
primers.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.BI "-f, --required-flag " INT|STR
Only output alignments with all bits set in
.I INT
present in the FLAG field.
.I INT
can be specified in hex by beginning with `0x' (i.e. /^0x[0-9A-F]+/)
or in octal by beginning with `0' (i.e. /^0[0-7]+/) [0],
or in string form by specifying a comma-separated list of keywords as
listed by the "samtools flags" subcommand.

.TP
.BI "-F, --filter-flag " INT|STR
Do not output alignments with any bits set in
.I INT
present in the FLAG field.
.I INT
can be specified in hex by beginning with `0x' (i.e. /^0x[0-9A-F]+/)
or in octal by beginning with `0' (i.e. /^0[0-7]+/) [0],
or in string form by specifying a comma-separated list of keywords as
listed by the "samtools flags" subcommand.

.TP
.BI "-a, --max-amplicons " INT
Specify the maximum number of amplicons permitted.

.TP
.BI "-d, --min-depth " INT
Specifies the minimum base depth to consider a reference position to
be covered, for purposes of the FRPERC and CRPERC sections.

.TP
.BI "-m, --pos-margin " INT
Reads are compared against the primer start and end locations
specified in the BED file.  An aligned sequence should start precisely
at these locations, but sequencing errors may cause the primer
clipping to be a few bases out or for the alignment to add a few extra
bases of soft clip.  This option specifies the margin of error
permitted when matching a read to an amplicon number.

.TP
.B "-o " FILE
Output stats to FILE.  The default is to write to stdout.

.TP
.B "-s, --use-sample-name"
Instead of using the basename component of the input path names, use
the SM field from the first @RG header line.

.TP
.B "-t, --tlen-adjust " INT
Adjust the TLEN field by +/- INT to compensate for primer clipping.
This defaults to zero, but if the primers have been clipped and the
TLEN field has not been updated using samtools fixmate then the
template length will be wrong by the sum of the forward and reverse
primer lengths.

This adjustment does not have to be precise as the --pos-margin field
permits some leeway.  Hence if required, it should be set to
approximately double the average primer length.

.TP
.BI "-@ " INT
Number of BAM/CRAM (de)compression threads to use in addition to main thread [0].

.SH EXAMPLE
