.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Generate consensus from a SAM, BAM or CRAM file based on the contents
of the alignment records.  The consensus is written either as FASTA or
FASTQ format, although a simplified pileup compatible format also
exists with the reference column replaced by the consensus.  This is
selected using the
.BI "-f " FORMAT
option.

The default output for FASTA and FASTQ formats include one base per
non-gap consensus.  Hence insertions with respect to the aligned
reference will be included and deletions removed.  This behaviour can
be controlled with the 
.B --show-ins
and
.B--show-del
options.  This could be used to compute a new reference from sequences
assemblies to realign against.  The pileup format strictly adheres to
one row per reference location, with insertions absent and deletions
shown as consensus "*".

Two consensus calling algorithms are offered.  The default is a pure
frequency count, summing either +1 for each base type or
.RI + qual
if the
.B --use-qual
option is specified.  The summed share of a specific base type
is then compared against the total possible and if this is above a the
.BI "--call-fract " fraction
parameter then most likely base type is called, or "N" otherwise (or
absent if it is a gap).  The
.B --ambig
option permits generation of ambiguity codes instead of "N", provided
the minimum fraction of the second most common base type to the most
common is above the
.BI "--het-fract " fraction "" \fR.

The
.B -5
option enables the "Gap5" compatible consensus algorithm.  This uses
the quality values in a Bayesian manner to derive the most likely
consensus base instead of a pure frequency based analysis.

Both methods also support the ability to embed base modification
mark-up into the consensus output when enabled using the
.B --output-mods
option.  The
.BR --mod-yes-cutoff,
.BR --mod-no-cutoff,
.BR --mod-fixed-prob " and"
.B --mod-cutoff
options can be used for adjusting the levels that a modification needs
ot be present before calling.
